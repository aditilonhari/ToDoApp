## Notes

This was my first time creating an Android app and working on Android studio. It was a great experience although, I faced a few challenges while working on this. 
I was getting an error on creating the ArrayList using todo.txt file. I tried to debug it and find solution for it online, when ultimately one of my friends, who is an android developer, 
suggested to create a local file and push it to device internal memory. It worked fine and later on I could figure the error I was facing.
Also, setting up styles on the various Widgets was a bit different coming from html-css world. Various subdirectories in "values" folder were used for styling.
